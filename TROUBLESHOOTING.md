# Troubleshooting the API Endpoint 404 Issue

I notice you're getting a 404 error with your API endpoint. Here's how to fix this issue for Vercel deployments:

## Solution Steps

1. **Verify the File Structure**:
   
   We've updated your project to follow the Vercel API Routes convention:
   ```
   api/
     contact/
       index.js  <- This is your API endpoint
   ```
   
   This file structure is the Vercel standard for API routes and should make the endpoint available at `/api/contact`.

2. **Update vercel.json**:
   
   We've simplified your `vercel.json` file to use Vercel's built-in routing with rewrites.

3. **Double-Check Environment Variables**:
   
   Make sure you've added these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`: TpQIAacccPn1TlZic
   - `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`: service_9t7d4n3
   - `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`: template_xdomisa

4. **Redeploy Your Project**:
   
   After making these changes, you need to redeploy your project to Vercel.

5. **Debug with Console Logs**:
   
   If the issue persists, you can add console.logs in your API route and check the Vercel logs:
   ```javascript
   // At the beginning of your handler function
   console.log('API endpoint called', req.method, req.url);
   console.log('Request body:', req.body);
   ```

## Alternative Implementation (If Needed)

If you continue to face issues, a different approach is to use Vercel's Next.js framework, which has built-in API route support:

1. Create a new Next.js project
2. Add your API routes in the `pages/api/` directory
3. Migrate your HTML/CSS/JS as static files

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **CORS Issues**: If your API works but returns CORS errors, add this to your response headers:
  ```javascript
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  ```

- **Path Mismatches**: Ensure your form is POSTing to the exact path `/api/contact`

- **Server-Side vs Client-Side**: Remember that server-side logs won't appear in the browser console

Remember to check the Vercel deployment logs for any errors during the build or runtime processes.
